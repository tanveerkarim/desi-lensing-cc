# DESI Imaging and Planck CMB Lensing Cross-Correlation

Authors: Tanveer Karim, Sukhdeep Singh

This code is under developement. We are using DESI DR8 Emission-Line Galaxies (ELGs) imaging data with Planck CMB Lensing 2018 data to get angular cross-power spectra and infer ELG bias, sigma8 and sum of neutrino masses.

Dependencies:
-- Skylens

Major themes (work in progress):
-- fully workable using healpix
-- Modular: plug in own n(z), LPT model
-- inference done with emcee
-- handles fuzzy window function 
-- baryonic model selection
